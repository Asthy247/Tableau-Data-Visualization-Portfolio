# Tableau-Data-Visualization-Portfolio
Welcome to my Tableau Data Visualization Portfolio! This repository showcases my expertise in transforming complex datasets into clear, interactive, 
and actionable dashboards using Tableau Public. My focus is on data storytelling, enabling users to quickly grasp key insights and make data-driven decisions.

# About Me
I am a results-driven Data Analyst with a strong passion for creating impactful and user-friendly interactive dashboards. Leveraging my proficiency in Python, R Programming, SAS, SQL, Excel, and my experience with large, complex datasets from both healthcare (Celerion Inc.) and campaign marketing (Dentsu), I excel at designing and building visualizations that communicate critical business insights. 
My goal is to empower stakeholders with intuitive tools that bring data to life.
